            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Shivaji was born in family of Bhonsle, a Maratha clan. Allison Busch, Professor at the University of Columbia states that Shivaji was not a Kshatriya as required and hence had to postpone the coronation until 1674 and hired Gaga Bhatt, a Brahmin scholar from Kashi to trace his ancestry back to the Sisodias.Historians such as Surendra Nath Sen and V. K. Rajwade reject the Sisodia origin by citing the temple inscription of Math, dated to 1397 A.D and holds the view that the genealogy was forged by Shivaji's men.Following the historical evidence it however seems explicit that Shivaji's linkage to Sisodia family of Mewar was inventive and a political move.Bhonsle originally originated from Deccani tiller-plainsmen who are known by various names as Kunbi or Maratha.In fact, Most of the Mawalas serving in the armies of the Maratha Empire under Shivaji came from this community</p>
