            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed"> 
                Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of Mhow in the Central Provinces
                 (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the 14th and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, 
                 and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar. His family was of Marathi background from the town of Ambadawe 
                 (Mandangad taluka) in Ratnagiri district of modern-day Maharashtra. Ambedkar was born into a poor low Mahar (dalit) caste,
                  who were treated as untouchables and subjected to socio-economic discrimination.
                  Ambedkar's ancestors had long worked for the army of the British East India Company, 
                  and his father served in the British Indian Army at the Mhow cantonment.Although they attended school,
                   Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers.
                    They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, 
                    someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or
                     the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school peon, 
                     and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as
                      "No peon, No Water".He was required to sit on a gunny sack which he had to take home with him.
